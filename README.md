# Development

This is a place for Development Tools, Apps & Links I found interesting to keep and use for later. It could be related to programming, but also to non-programming projects, such as videos, drawings, ideas, writings. This is also the place where I will be linking my projects and their progress, with either: 
* ✅ `completed`
* 🕑 `working-on`
* 📝 `to-do`
* ❌ `gave-up`
